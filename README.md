Deep Reinforcement Learning to Walk lets you train an AI bot that gets smarter over time using reinforcement learning. </br></br>

The bot will improve as it learns from its experiences in three different environments:
<ul>
  <li>Even Terrain: A flat surface to start training.</li>
  <li>Uneven Terrain: More challenging with unpredictable surfaces.</li>
  <li>Inclined Terrain: Test your botâ€™s ability to navigate slopes.</li>
</ul>

Watch your bot learn, adapt, and get better in real-time!
